    "Ghouls are the smarter cousins of Zombies. Though they are undead, they crave to feast on the living. Ghouls will attack any farm animals. They can pick up meat, including rotten flesh, and heal themselves. Ghouls are hurt by sunlight, but it does not burn them as long as Zombies. Seeking shelter from Ghouls can be tricky as they can open doors.",
